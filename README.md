# Comment-Toxicity-Level-Detection-Model-using-Python-and-Deep-Learning
We will be able to take sentences of natural language from a dataset which was provided in jigsaw toxic comment classification challenge and then pass it through a deep learning model and then detect the different elements of toxicity within them.

Steps:
1. Data Loading
2. Comments Preprocessing
3. Creating a Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model
4. Evaluation of Model Performance
5. Creating a Gradio Deep Learning App to test our model
